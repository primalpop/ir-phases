\begin{abstract}

Search engines are one of the most used web applications today. Outlines some of the challenges and goes deep into the the topic of refresh policies related to web crawling. Surveys existing techniques to solve the problem and also verifies how much of challenges mentioned in seminal papers were covered and presents new challenges to be tackled in this domain.

\section*{Introduction}

For many of us a search engine is the starting point of the Internet. We browse the web using Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo or any other search engine to find what we are looking for. In a nutshell, an user interacts with search engine by entering some keywords as a query and receive web pages that contain the keyword and ranked according to relevancy. \\

This is an oversimplified explaination of how the search engine works. The size of web and the frequency at which it changes makes it much more challenging than a simple information retrieval problem. To add some perspective to the problem at hand, 20 million pages were indexed by AltaVista in 1995 when most of the seminal papers related to this topic were written. Fast-forwarding to 2008, 1 trillion URLs were known by Google and Yahoo. Each of web pages contained 10 - 100 KB of textual content and roughly has 100 links per page. \cite{stats2008st} \\ 

Before going into the details of Web Crawling, it is important to understand how a search engine is assembled together. Figure 1 below the schema of a search engine from the works of \cite{arasu2001searching}. As seen in the figure, a search engine relies on a \textit{crawler} which browses the Web on it's behalf. Starting from a set of URLs, this module follows the links and retrieve pages from the Web into a page repository until a stop criterion is met. Crawling operations will be explained in more detail in the following section. \\

\end{figure}

The indexer module builds an index by extracting tokens from the pages in the repository. It generates a look up table where words act as keys and the URLs that point to the page they occur in are values. The collection analysis module is responsible for creating various types of utility indexes which provides access to pages with specific structure and content (contains some number of images) \cite{arasu2001searching}. Query engine deals with user requests and uses the indexes to retrieve the URLs of relevant pages from the repository. Ranking module does the task of sorting results so that results near the top are most likely to be of interest to the user. \\

In rest of the paper, we describe in more detail the web crawling aspect of the search engine. This paper serves as an Introduction to the challenges associated with keeping web crawl updated and some interesting techniques that have been developed over the years. \\

\subsection{Crawling Challenges}

As mentioned earlier, the Web is enormous and therefore web crawling comes with its unique set of challenges as outlined by \cite{arasu2001searching}.

\begin{enumerate}

\item What pages should the crawler download?

\item How should the crawler refresh pages? 

\item How to be unobstrusive on the web servers being visited?

\item How to parallize the crawling the process? 

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Crawler Design Issues}

\section{Revisiting policies}

\subsection{Proportional Policy}
